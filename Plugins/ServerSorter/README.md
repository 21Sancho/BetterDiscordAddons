# ServerSorter - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/ServerSorter/ServerSorter.plugin.js)

Adds the ability to do some basic sorting of your servers. For support and update announcements you can visit [Zere's server](http://discord.zackrauen.com/).

**Note:** This is currently in beta and does not save the order of the servers on restart. It also will not update the order across devices.
