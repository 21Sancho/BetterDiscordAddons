# StatusEverywhere - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Plugins/StatusEverywhere/StatusEverywhere.plugin.js)

Adds user status everywhere Discord doesn't. For support and update announcements you can visit [Zere's server](https://bit.ly/ZeresServer).

**Note:** ~~This is currently in beta and cause slight lag on switching channels/servers.~~ This should be fixed

## What's New

### Updated Method

After exploring some react data with DevilBro (Mirco)#4401 I was able to come up with a new way to collect and process the status data. This release should be much much faster and much more reliable for determining status.

## Features

Adds a status component on any object it can find that does not have one by default

### Locations

#### Messages

## Plugin Settings

Currently there are no settings. 

## Coming Soon
 - ~~Making it lagless~~
 - Adding statuses to pinned messages
 - Statuses in search results

## Known Bugs and Issues
 - Lag
 - Sometimes jumps when you send a message
