# Radial Status - [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/master/Themes/RadialStatus/RadialStatus.theme.css)

Changes all instances of the status dot to a status circle except for the friends list. This is an update to Zerthox's StatusCircles to fix small issues as well as add the circles everywhere else possible.

This should also be compatible with Beard's Material Design Theme as long as this is loaded afterward.
